# MQTT_Awtrix3
a simple mqtt for weather made on seezeit by unix (me) ... Compatible with Ulanzi tc001 with awtrix3 firmware- you can try it with any mqtt that shows information like the awtrix3 firmware but you should check it 


#Installing or building
I made a tool to build your custom one (called awtrix_builder.py)
--- It installes everything ----

# YOU CAN USE MY ONE BUT PLS DONT RUN IT WITHOUT CHANGES
You should change the ip if you dont run it on localhost 
You should change the port if you dont use mosquittos default port
